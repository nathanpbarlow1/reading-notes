# Reading Notes: Class 6: Javascript & jQuery

## 6a reading notes section notes:

### How HTML, CSS and JavaScript fit together: these three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building webpage  called progressive enhancement.

HTML <html> 	is the content layer
	.html
CSS {css}	 is the presentation layer	
  .css
Javascript ()	is the Behavioral layer	
  .js

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.

You may see Javascript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files).
