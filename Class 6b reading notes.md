# How Computers Work - Video Reading Notes

## What makes a computer a computer?
- Similar to how humans have come up with inventions over time to helps us with manual work, the computer has allowed us to help with the"thinking" type of work. 
- Essentially a computer needs an input, the ability to store that information, process that information, and output the results. 
- Earliest computers were wood and metal, large, and very slow. Now, we use modern electrical components. 
- Input: "fingerprint"
- Storage: where the input "lives"
- Processing: memory which then uses an algorithm (list of commands for processing) and then moves it back to memory. 
- Output: depends on what the computer is designed to do (games/Vr/Robots, etc.)

## How Computers Work:  Binary & Data
- Almost nobody today works directly with 1's and 0's
- How do you store or represent information using electricity?
  If you have a single wire with electrictiy flowing through it, the signal can either be on or off. With 1 wire we caqn represent 'yes' or 'no', or true or false. This is known as a 'bit'. The more wires, the more complex the logic. 
- with 0 and 1 we can count up to any number. For example, '9' would be 1001 (first digit is multipied by 8, 2nd by 4, 3rd by 2, and last digit by 1)
- Text in binary: also stored and sequence of numbers
- Sound: vibrations can be represented as a waveform, which is represented by a number. 

## Circuits & Logic
 - In order to process the info as output, a computer needs to modify and combinew the input signals. A computer does this by using components that forms as circuits. 
 - If you give a circuit a 1, it turns it into a 0, and vice versa.
 - The smaller the circuit, the less distance information has to travel. 

## CPU, Memory, Input & output
- Input devices converts physical input to binary information. CPU can take many different types of input. (mic, gps, keyboard, etc.)
- Memory stores information
- CPU: Central Processing Unit calculates information
- Output: converts information to physical output
- Modern computers have multiple CPUs.

## Hardware and Software
- Software is all the programs and codes running on a machine
- How do they interact together? CPU: master chips that controls all the other parts of the computer. The CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use. 
- Operating System: The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer (Windows OS, Linux, etc.)
