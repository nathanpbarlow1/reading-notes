## Comparison and logical operators:  Evaluating Conditions (150-151, 156, and 157)

==	Is equal to	This operator  compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same.
!=	Is NOT equal to	This operator  compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are NOT the same.
===	Strict Equal to	This operator compares 2 values to check that both the data type and value are the same.
!==	Strict Not Equal to	This operator compares 2 values to check that both the data type and value are not the same.
Ø 	Greater than	
	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal to	
<=	Less than or equal to	
&&	Logical AND	This operator tests more than one condition
| |	Logical OR	This operator tests at least one condition
!	Logical NOT	This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it…i.e. !(2 < 1) returns TRUE

## Logical Operators

Comparison operators usually returns single values of true or false.

**Logical Operators** allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

Do expression 1 and expression 2 both evaluate to true?
 - False

Expression 3

((5<2) && (2 >= 3))

Expression 1, Logical Operator, Expression 2 (example above)

Is five less than two?	False
Is two greater than or equal to three?	False

**Short-Circuit Evaluation**: logical expressions are a valuated left to right. If the first condition can provide enough information to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition. 

**for** and **while** loops: 170-173, and 176
