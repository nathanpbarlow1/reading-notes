### Lets talk about Growth Mindset

>“*You have three bad quarters, you’ve thrown four interceptions, you own that,” he said. “But the next seven minutes are going to be based on what you do, not what you did.” - Russell Wilson, QB - Seattle Seahawks*

### How will I keep myself in a growth mindset?

1. Start the day by reading for at least 15 minutes
1. Surround myself with like-minded friends
1. Reflect on my accomplishments, no feat. is too small!

### Growth Mindset, explained in my own words

To me, growth mindset means never being believing that you can't accomplish something. Maybe I'm not capable of coding a website today, but if I have the desire and willingness to learn how to code I can build a fully functional and beautifully designed website in the future. Don't give up! Believe in yourself and your ability to learn!

### Highlights of what I've learned thus far

Learning about all the capabilities of GitHub has been the most enjoyable part of my course experience thus far. Not only will they help you learn how to build websites easily through GitHub pages, they also provide resources that help you land a job. They provide numerous templates and resources to help you get started without having to do some of the more technical heavy-lifting like database set-up or server configuration.

Additionally, they also have publishing resources through open-source tools that help you with other projects like building out document libraries or blogs.

GitHub also allows you to code with [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), an easy to use syntax for styling your websites content.

Markdown allows you to format your site's text with headers, emphasize text via bolding, create unordered and ordered lists, link images and websites and more! It's a great introduction into coding without having to jump into HTML.
