- [Class 1: Growth Mindset](https://growthmindset.org/).

### Lets talk about Growth Mindset

### How will I keep myself in a growth mindset?

- [ ] Start the day by reading for at least 15 minutes
- [ ] Surround myself with like-minded friends
- [ ] Reflect on my accomplishments, no feat. is too small!

### Growth Mindset, explained in my own words:

To me, growth mindset means never being believing that you can't accomplish something. Maybe I'm not capable of coding a website today, but if I have the desire and willingness to learn how to code I can build a fully functional and beautifully designed website in the future. Don't give up! Believe in yourself and your ability to learn!
