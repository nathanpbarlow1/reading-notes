### Lets talk about Growth Mindset

How can I keepy myself in a growth mindset?

- Self-discovery
- Be mindul of my thinking

### Growth Mindset, explained in my own words:

To me, growth mindset means never being believing that you can't accomplish something. Maybe I'm not capable of coding a website today, but if I have the desire and willingness to learn how to code I can build a fully functional and beautifully designed website in the future. Don't give up! Believe in yourself and your ability to learn!
