**headings** HTML has 6 levels of headings, the `<h1>` through `<h6>` tags.

**paragraphs** use the `<\p>` tag

**superscript and subscript** `<sup` element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as suffixes of dates or mathmatical concepts like raising a number to a power. (pp. 46) 

**whitespace** Used to make code easier to read. When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly, if it comes across a line break and treats that as a single space too. This is known as **white space collapsing** (pp. 47)

**Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules** `<br />` `hr />`

**Visual editors** Often resemble word processors. Although each editor will differ a slightly, there are some features that are common to most editors that allow you to control the presentation of text.

**code views** Show you the code created by the visual editor so you can manually edit it, or so you can just enter new code yourself. It is often activated using a button with an icon that says HTML or has angled brackets. White space may be added to the code by the editor to make the code easier to read.

**Semantic Markup** Text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your webpages, but they do add extra information to the pages.
